Ensuring Compliance and Differentiation in a Non-Medical Context
 
Regulatory Scope and Applicable Frameworks
 
In Phase 1, Vitalyst is positioned as a knowledge platform focused on educating users about vitamins, nutrients, and their physiological roles. It includes an e-commerce shop for food supplements and interactive tools like a 3D digital twin for learning. At this stage, Vitalyst is explicitly not a medical product, avoiding regulation under frameworks such as the EU Medical Device Regulation (MDR 2017/745) or medicinal product laws. Below is a comprehensive review of applicable regulations and compliance strategies.
 
Exclusion from MDR (Medical Device Regulation, EU 2017/745)
 
Key Points of MDR:
 
MDR applies to devices or software that:
Diagnose, prevent, monitor, treat, or alleviate diseases or injuries.
Modify physiological or anatomical functions through medical means.
 
Applicability to Vitalyst Phase 1:
Non-Medical Purpose: Vitalyst is designed for educational purposes only, providing general information about vitamins and nutrients.
No Diagnostic Functionality: The platform does not process or analyze personal health data to provide individualized recommendations.
E-Commerce Focus: The shop exclusively sells food supplements classified as Nahrungsergänzungsmittel (food supplements), not medical products or devices.
 
Compliance Actions:
Clearly state the platform’s purpose as educational and informational.
Include disclaimers such as:
“This platform is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease. It is for general educational purposes only.”
Ensure that the 3D digital twin and interactive tools are framed as visual aids for understanding nutrient interactions, not as diagnostic tools.
 
Exclusion from Medicinal Product Regulations (Directive 2001/83/EC)
 
Key Points of Directive 2001/83/EC:
 
This directive governs substances classified as medicinal products, which are defined as:
By Presentation: Products presented as having properties for treating or preventing disease in humans.
By Function: Products that exert pharmacological, immunological, or metabolic effects to modify physiological functions.
 
Applicability to Vitalyst Phase 1:
No Therapeutic Claims: The supplements sold on the platform are not marketed as products for treating or preventing diseases.
Focus on Nutrition: Supplements are labeled and marketed as general food supplements (Nahrungsergänzungsmittel), adhering to their nutritional and physiological role without suggesting pharmacological effects.
 
Compliance Actions:
Avoid any language suggesting medical or therapeutic effects (e.g., “heals,” “treats,” or “cures”).
Position supplements as tools to supplement the diet, not as solutions for health conditions.
Ensure clear and accurate labeling to differentiate supplements from medicinal products.
 
Compliance with Food Supplements Regulation (NemV - Germany)
 
Key Points of Food Supplements Regulation:
 
Food supplements are concentrated sources of nutrients intended to supplement the normal diet. Their sale is governed by the following rules:
Safe Dosage: Supplements must comply with maximum safe levels (upper limits) established by the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) or German regulations.
Proper Labeling: Packaging must include statements such as:
“Food supplement.”
“Not a substitute for a varied and balanced diet.”
“Do not exceed the recommended daily dose.”
 
Compliance Actions:
Stay within EFSA-defined upper safe limits for nutrient dosages.
Ensure proper labeling of all supplements sold, with clear disclaimers about their intended use.
Include guidance for responsible use, such as:
“This product is intended to complement a healthy diet. Consult a healthcare professional before use if you are pregnant, nursing, or taking medications.”
 
Compliance with EU Regulation No 1924/2006 on Nutrition and Health Claims
 
Key Points of the Regulation:
 
This regulation governs the use of nutrition and health claims in the EU to ensure they are:
Scientifically Substantiated: Claims must be based on approved health benefits listed in the EU Register of Nutrition and Health Claims.
Not Misleading: Claims should not exaggerate benefits or imply medical efficacy.
 
Compliance Actions:
Use only approved claims for vitamins and nutrients, such as:
“Vitamin D contributes to the maintenance of normal bones.”
“Vitamin C contributes to the normal functioning of the immune system.”
Avoid vague or non-approved claims like “Boosts energy” or “Improves health.”
Ensure all claims are specific, measurable, and linked to recognized scientific evidence.
 
Compliance with Heilmittelwerbegesetz (HWG - German Medical Advertising Law)
 
Key Points of HWG:
 
This law regulates advertising for health-related products and services to prevent misleading claims and protect consumers.
 
Compliance Actions:
Avoid using medical imagery, language, or endorsements that imply the platform or its products have therapeutic value.
Ensure that all advertising materials are factual, transparent, and focus on the educational purpose of the platform.
 
General Consumer Protection Laws
 
Key Points:
Comply with EU Directive 2005/29/EC on Unfair Commercial Practices, ensuring all marketing is truthful and non-deceptive.
Provide transparent information about product pricing, sourcing, and intended use.
 
Compliance Actions:
Include clear terms and conditions on the website.
Provide customer support to address user inquiries about the platform and its products.
 
Summary of Compliance Strategy for Phase 1
Regulatory Exclusions:
The platform is not a medical device under MDR or a medicinal product under Directive 2001/83/EC.
Supplements are marketed solely as food supplements, not as therapeutic agents.
Clear Positioning:
State the educational and informational purpose of the platform.
Avoid therapeutic or diagnostic claims.
Labeling and Claims:
Use only approved nutrition and health claims.
Clearly label supplements as “food supplements” with disclaimers.
Transparent Marketing:
Ensure all communications comply with advertising standards and avoid misleading language.
