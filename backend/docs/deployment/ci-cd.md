# CI/CD Pipeline Documentation

## Overview
The Vitalyst Knowledge Graph uses GitHub Actions for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment, providing automated testing, building, and deployment processes while maintaining zero-trust security principles.

## Workflows

### Main Pipeline (`main.yml`)
Triggered on:
- Push to main, develop, feature/*, release/* branches
- Pull requests to main and develop

#### Jobs:
1. **Test**
   - Matrix testing (Python 3.12, Node.js 18)
   - Backend tests with coverage
   - Frontend tests with coverage
   - Coverage report upload

2. **Lint**
   - Backend code formatting (black)
   - Frontend linting (ESLint)
   - TypeScript type checking

3. **Security**
   - Dependency scanning (Snyk)
   - Container scanning (Trivy)
   - Static analysis (CodeQL)
   - Secret scanning
   - Infrastructure scanning

4. **Build**
   - Multi-stage Docker builds
   - Container registry push
   - Build caching
   - Version tagging

5. **Deploy Staging**
   - AWS EKS deployment
   - Kubernetes manifests
   - Health checks
   - Environment validation

6. **Deploy Production**
   - Production deployment
   - Zero-downtime updates
   - Rollback capability
   - Production verification

### Release Pipeline (`release.yml`)
Triggered on:
- Tag push (v*)

#### Jobs:
1. **Create Release**
   - Changelog generation
   - Release creation
   - Documentation update

2. **Build and Push**
   - Version tagging
   - Latest tag update
   - Registry push

3. **Deploy**
   - Production deployment
   - Version verification
   - Health monitoring

## Security Measures

### Code Scanning
- Dependency vulnerability scanning
- Container image scanning
- Static code analysis
- Infrastructure as Code scanning
- Secret detection

### Deployment Security
- Environment isolation
- Secure secret handling
- Infrastructure validation
- Access control
- Audit logging

### Registry Security
- Container signing
- Image scanning
- Access control
- Version control
- Vulnerability monitoring

## Environment Configuration

### Development
- Hot reload enabled
- Debug logging
- Test coverage
- Local scanning

### Staging
- Production-like environment
- Integration testing
- Performance monitoring
- Security validation

### Production
- High availability
- Auto-scaling
- Enhanced security
- Performance optimization
- Monitoring and alerting

## Best Practices

### Code Quality
- Automated testing
- Code coverage
- Style enforcement
- Type checking
- Documentation validation

### Security
- Dependency scanning
- Container scanning
- Infrastructure validation
- Secret management
- Access control

### Deployment
- Zero-downtime updates
- Automated rollbacks
- Health checks
- Resource management
- Performance monitoring

## Monitoring

### Metrics
- Build success rate
- Test coverage
- Security findings
- Deployment time
- Error rates

### Alerts
- Build failures
- Test failures
- Security issues
- Deployment issues
- Performance degradation

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Build Failures
   - Check dependency issues
   - Verify test failures
   - Review resource limits

2. Deployment Failures
   - Check credentials
   - Verify manifests
   - Review logs

3. Security Issues
   - Review scan results
   - Check dependencies
   - Verify configurations
