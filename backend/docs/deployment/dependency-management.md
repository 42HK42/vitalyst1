# Dependency Management Policy

## Overview
This document outlines the dependency management policies and procedures for the Vitalyst Knowledge Graph project. These guidelines ensure security, stability, and maintainability across all project dependencies.

## Version Control Strategy

### Backend Dependencies
- Use exact version pinning (e.g., `package==1.2.3`)
- Review and update dependencies monthly
- Major version updates require thorough testing and team review
- Security updates should be applied within 48 hours of notification

### Frontend Dependencies
- Use caret ranges for minor versions (e.g., `^1.2.3`)
- Lock file (`package-lock.json`) must be committed
- Weekly automated dependency updates via Dependabot
- Major version updates require team review

## Update Schedule

### Regular Updates
- Security patches: Immediate review and update
- Minor versions: Monthly review
- Major versions: Quarterly review
- Development dependencies: Monthly review

### Emergency Updates
- Critical security vulnerabilities: Immediate action required
- Breaking changes: Emergency team review required
- Production impact: Rollback plan must be documented

## Security Measures

### Vulnerability Scanning
- Daily automated scans using:
  - Backend: Safety DB, Snyk
  - Frontend: npm audit, Snyk
  - Container: Trivy
- Weekly manual review of security advisories
- Monthly comprehensive security audit

### Version Constraints
- Production dependencies:
  - Must have type definitions
  - Must be actively maintained
  - Must have >10k weekly downloads
  - Must have security policy
- Development dependencies:
  - Must be compatible with CI/CD pipeline
  - Must support current Node.js LTS

## Update Process

### Pre-Update Checklist
1. Create update branch
2. Run vulnerability scan
3. Check changelog for breaking changes
4. Review dependency tree for conflicts
5. Verify license compliance

### Testing Requirements
1. Run full test suite
2. Verify development environment
3. Check build process
4. Run integration tests
5. Perform manual smoke test

### Deployment Process
1. Stage updates in development
2. Run performance benchmarks
3. Deploy to staging environment
4. Monitor for 24 hours
5. Deploy to production

## Documentation Requirements

### Update Documentation
- Document all major version updates
- Note any breaking changes
- Update API documentation if needed
- Record any required configuration changes

### Changelog Updates
- List security fixes
- Document breaking changes
- Note performance improvements
- Record compatibility changes

## Tools and Automation

### Automated Tools

- pip-audit for Python
- npm audit for Node.js
- pre-commit hooks
- CI/CD pipeline checks

### Manual Review Tools
- pip-review
- npm-check-updates
- bundlephobia
- snyk advisor

## Emergency Procedures

### Critical Vulnerabilities
1. Immediate team notification
2. Create incident report
3. Implement temporary mitigation
4. Apply security patch
5. Post-mortem analysis

### Rollback Procedures
1. Maintain rollback scripts
2. Document version dependencies
3. Test rollback process
4. Monitor system metrics
5. Communicate with stakeholders

## Compliance and Auditing

### License Compliance
- Maintain license inventory
- Review new dependency licenses
- Document license conflicts
- Update legal documentation

### Audit Requirements
- Monthly dependency audit
- Quarterly security review
- Annual compliance check
- Maintain audit logs

## Best Practices

### Development Guidelines
- Use minimal dependencies
