## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of Vitalyst Knowledge Graph seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

### How to Report a Security Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them via email to [security@vitalyst.com](mailto:security@vitalyst.com). You should receive a response within 48 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message.

Please include the following information in your report:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### What to Expect

- A confirmation of your report within 48 hours
- An assessment of the reported vulnerability within 7 days
- Regular updates about our progress if the resolution takes longer
- Credit for your responsible disclosure, if desired

### Security Best Practices

1. **API Keys and Secrets**
   - Never commit API keys, passwords, or other secrets to the repository
   - Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration
   - Rotate API keys and secrets regularly

2. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - Always use HTTPS for API endpoints
   - Implement proper session management
   - Use secure password hashing (bcrypt)
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints

3. **Data Protection**
   - Encrypt sensitive data at rest
   - Use TLS 1.3 for data in transit
   - Implement proper access controls
   - Regular security audits

4. **Development**
   - Keep dependencies up to date
   - Regular security scanning of dependencies
   - Code review for security implications
   - Security-focused testing

5. **CI/CD Security**
   - Automated security scanning in pipelines
     - Snyk for dependency vulnerabilities
     - Trivy for container scanning
     - CodeQL for static code analysis
     - Secret scanning for credential leaks
     - Infrastructure scanning for misconfigurations
   - Secure deployment processes
     - Environment isolation
     - Secure secret management
     - Infrastructure validation
     - Access control and audit logging
   - Container security
     - Image signing and verification
     - Base image scanning
     - Runtime security monitoring
     - Resource isolation
   - Build security
     - Reproducible builds
     - Dependency verification
     - Artifact signing
     - Build environment isolation

6. **Infrastructure**
   - Regular security updates for all systems
   - Network security monitoring
   - Proper firewall configuration
   - Regular security assessments

## Security Measures

### Continuous Security
- Automated security testing in CI/CD pipeline
- Real-time vulnerability monitoring
- Automated security patches
- Dependency update automation
- Container security scanning
- Infrastructure as Code validation
- Compliance automation
- Security metrics and reporting

### Data Security
- All data is encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption
- Sensitive data is encrypted in transit using TLS 1.3
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Comprehensive access control and authentication system

### Application Security
- Input validation and sanitization
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection)
- Regular dependency updates and security patches
- Secure session management

### Infrastructure Security
- Regular system updates and patch management
- Network security monitoring and intrusion detection
- Secure backup systems and disaster recovery
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

## Compliance

We are committed to:
- GDPR compliance for EU data protection
- HIPAA compliance for health information
- Regular security audits and assessments
- Maintaining up-to-date security documentation

## Security Updates

Security updates will be released as soon as possible after a vulnerability is confirmed. Updates will be distributed through:
- GitHub releases
- Security advisories
- Email notifications to registered users

## Bug Bounty Program

We currently do not have a bug bounty program, but we greatly appreciate responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities.
